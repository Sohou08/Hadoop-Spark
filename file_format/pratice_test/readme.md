## Comparison file formats: Practical test

After the quick review of file format comparison ([theorical comparison](https://github.com/Sohou08/Hadoop-Spark/tree/master/file_format)), it seems relevant to practice some principle embodied on the literature. Those tests will allow to check some statements made on the different types of formats (CSV, JSON, AVRO,ORC,...) through hive database, different types of data and specific request.

## Requirement Environment

  * __Characteristics of the cluster__
  
  * __Database Choice__
  
  * __datasets types__
  
  * __Requests types__
